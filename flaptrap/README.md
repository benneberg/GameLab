About the Game

Welcome to FlapTrap, the game where timing, gravity, and your reflexes collide in a chaotic neon arcade experience. Navigate your flappy avatar through moving obstacles, avoid saws, orbiting circles, swinging pendulums, and more — all while the world flips upside down at random (or beat-synced) intervals!

Daily Challenges: Face the same seeded obstacle course as everyone else today and try to beat the leaderboard.
Random Runs: Infinite procedural chaos for endless replayability.

Gameplay
	•	Tap to flap: Keep your flappy hero aloft.
	•	Tilt and move: Tap left/right to dodge obstacles.
	•	Gravity flips: Watch for a 3-2-1 countdown before the world inverts!
	•	Mirror mode: Sometimes controls are reversed — stay sharp.
	•	Beat-synced obstacles: Obstacles spawn in time with the procedural music.

Avoid spikes, rotating saws, swinging pendulums, orbiting hazards, and ever-moving walls. Each pattern is procedurally generated with beat-specific weights, so no two runs feel the same.
